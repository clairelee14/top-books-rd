This was a cataloging project done in PHP and MySQL
I created this basic CRUD list based off of Reader's Digest's Top 100 Books.
You're able to add, edit and delete books and those with awards have special badges on the book cover images.

In a similar project but with the use of codeigniter, I used the same concept of creating a list of books but more so like GoodReads, you were able to login into an account and create a list and only be able to edit and delete books that you uploaded and only be able to view the ones that other accounts uploaded.
